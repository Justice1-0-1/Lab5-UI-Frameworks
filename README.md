# Lab 5: UI Frameworks in Practice – Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js

## Objective:
The goal of this lab was to explore and apply **Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React.js** for building responsive web pages and interactive UI components. You will:
- Style web layouts with **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Compare utility-first vs component-based design systems.
- Create a dynamic **React.js** app using components, props, and state, understanding the differences between manual DOM logic and React’s declarative approach.

## Part 1 – Bootstrap Layout:
In this part, I created a simple page layout using Bootstrap:
- **Navbar**: Added a clean and basic Bootstrap navbar to help with navigation.
- **Two-Column Layout**: Leveraged Bootstrap’s grid system to design a responsive two-column layout.
- **Styled Button & Alert**: Used Bootstrap components for creating a styled button and alert box to demonstrate easy UI elements.

## Part 2 – Tailwind CSS Responsive Section:
Next, I created a responsive section using Tailwind CSS:
- Built a **card-style layout** containing an **image**, **headline**, and a **call-to-action button** using Tailwind classes like `bg-blue-500`, `rounded`, and `text-white`.
- Applied **responsive design** principles by using `md:grid-cols-2` to switch from a single-column to a two-column layout on medium screens.
- Tailwind's utility-first classes provided flexibility and customization options without the need for writing custom CSS.

## Part 3 – React.js Interactive Component:
In the final part, I created a React.js app to build an interactive component:
- Displayed a **welcome message** dynamically with a name passed through **props**.
- Implemented a button that toggles a message on/off using **useState**, showing React's declarative approach to managing UI state and interaction.

## Lab Deliverables:
- **GitHub Repository** with the following:
  - `bootstrap-demo`: HTML file showcasing Bootstrap layout.
  - `tailwind-demo`: HTML file showcasing the Tailwind section.
  - `react-demo`: Link to the **CodeSandbox** project or exported **App.js** file.
  - `README.md`: Describes the work completed, tools used, and lessons learned.
  
- **Google Classroom** submission: A video recording demonstrating the project in action.

## Tools Used:
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework that allows for fast and responsive web design through predefined classes and components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for flexible, customizable designs with small utility classes.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library used for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces with components that manage their state.

## My Experience:
Throughout the lab, I got hands-on experience with three powerful tools for web development: 
**Bootstrap** was simple to implement and provided a quick way to build a clean, responsive design, though its rigidity could be limiting for more custom designs. Altough it does makes it easier for the beginner. 
**Tailwind CSS**, in contrast, gave me complete freedom to design without relying on predefined styles, but it required more thoughtful structuring with an arguably higher learning curve. 
**React.js** was the most engaging part, allowing me to create dynamic user interfaces with the declarative approach of updating the DOM automatically when the state changes. This experience helped me understand the benefits of using frameworks and libraries tailored for specific development needs.
